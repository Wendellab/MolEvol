Molecular evolution analyses for consensus sequences from sequence capture

Taj1DRelRateTest.R - perform Tajima's 1D Relative Rate Test with alignments in FASTA format

MuseWeirRelRateTest.R - a handling script for the results of HyPhy's implementation of relative rate test

NormKsComp.R - compares rates of evolution between polyploid subgenomes by normalizing for differences in evolutionary rates
